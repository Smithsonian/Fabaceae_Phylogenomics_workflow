# Running SVDquartets
## What we need:
1. PAUP. You can ontain free test version from [here](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~dswofford/paup_test/). SVDquartets implemented in the PAUP.
2. Data file in the nexus format with the partition blocks and preferable species block! An example of nexus file with partitions can be obtained from [here](http://www.stat.osu.edu/~lkubatko/data-snakes.nex) from Kubatko et al. (Syst. Biol. 60(4): 393-409, 2011).





There is a great tutorial [here](http://www.stat.osu.edu/~lkubatko/SVDquartets_tutorial2015.html) on running SVDquartets.
