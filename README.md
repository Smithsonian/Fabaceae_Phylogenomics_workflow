# Fabaceae phylogenomics workflow
This repository contains instructions on handling target-enrichment (bait-capture) data using [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) and performing subsequent phylogenetic analyses on the Smithsonian Institution HPC (Hydra cluster). If you don't have your own dataset, you can use tutorial data from [here](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/tree/master/test_dataset). If you don't have access to the cluster, install all [dependencies](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper#dependencies) and programs used here such as MAFFT, TrimAl, RAxML on your system and run the main commands from the job files. Follow steps in the [Data_processing.md](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Fabaceae_Phylogenomics_workflow/blob/master/Data_processing.md).
