# Phylogenomics
This repository contains short instructions on handling target-enrichment (bait-capture) dataset using [Phyluce](https://github.com/faircloth-lab/phyluce) and [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) pipelines on the Smithsonian Institution Hydra cluster. If you don't have your own dataset, you can use original UCE tutorial data from [figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1284521) (1 GB) or from [here](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/tree/master/test_dataset) for the HybPiper.
