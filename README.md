# Phylogenomics
This repository contains my instructions on handling target-enrichment (bait-capture) dataset using [phyluce](https://github.com/faircloth-lab/phyluce) pipeline on the Smithsonian Institution Hydra cluster. If you don't have your own dataset, you can use original UCE tutorial data from [figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1284521) (1 GB).
