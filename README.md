# Fabaceae phylogenomics workflow
This repository contains instructions on handling target-enrichment (bait-capture) data using [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) and performing subsequent phylogenetic analyses on the Smithsonian Institution HPC (Hydra). If you don't have your own dataset, you can use tutorial data from [here](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/tree/master/test_dataset). You can also install all applications and dependencies on your system and run the main commands from the job files. Follow steps in the [Data_processing.md](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Fabaceae_Phylogenomics_workflow/blob/master/Data_processing.md).



Example phylogenetic trees using different species tree reconstruction methods.
