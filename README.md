# Fabaceae phylogenomics workflow
This repository contains instructions on handling target-enrichment (bait-capture) data using [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) and performing subsequent phylogenetic analyses on the Smithsonian Institution HPC (Hydra). If you don't have your own dataset, you can use tutorial data from [here](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/tree/master/test_dataset). And if you don't have access to Hydra you can install all applications and dependencies on your system and just run the main commands in the job files in you machine. Follow steps in the [Data_processing.md](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Fabaceae_Phylogenomics_workflow/blob/master/Data_processing.md).



Phylogenetic trees using different species tree reconstruction methods.
