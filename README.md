# Phylogenomics
This repository contains short instructions on handling target-enrichment (bait-capture) dataset using [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) pipeline on the Smithsonian Institution Hydra cluster. If you don't have your own dataset, you can use tutorial data from [here](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/tree/master/test_dataset).
